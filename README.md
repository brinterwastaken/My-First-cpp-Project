My first project with c++. Basic math calculations. 
- You can reach the integer limit by Multiplying the square root of 2^31-1 with itself. Since the variables x and y are integers, it rounds the square root of the integer limit to the next number (integer). When it multiplies, it exceeds the integer limit hence giving the answer of 0.

Building- (Linux with g++) `g++ -g file.cpp -o file` Where file is adder main or multiplier
